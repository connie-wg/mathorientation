    {advice: "Find a system that works for you, personally brainstorming on a whiteboard was awesome because I felt like I could jot down ideas without wasting paper. If I came up with something worthwhile to keep I would take a picture. Do lots and lots of practice problems, don't just read your notes while studying!!"},
    {advice: "Do not try to remember everything on your course notes, make sure you know how to do every single practice problem instead."},
    {advice: "Use office hours, but do not solely rely on them for assignments. Assignments are important, but not nearly as important as understanding, which is the only thing that will help you in exams and count in the long run."},
    {advice: "Practice makes permanent. Do those practice tests! That's what helped me the most."},
    {advice: "Take notes in class, use LaTeX"}
