    {advice: "I think the biggest thing for mental well-being is having balance. There are times where you need to hunker down and study, but you need to be able to balance that with time to socialize and hang out with your friends, or family, or just be by yourself and relax. Otherwise, you'll be burnout prone (like I was). Honestly, if I were to do it all again, I would care a little less about marks and a little more about having fun because 10 years down the line, I'm not gonna be like \"Damn I\'m really thankful I spent that evening studying instead of going out to that frat party my roommate invited me to\". But again, all about balance. Can\'t party everyday :)"}
