    {advice: "Keep a list of questions, confusing concepts, or problems you couldn't solve for each course. Add to it throughout the semester and cross things off if you figure them out. This list gives you an easy way to remember what to ask about during office hours or tutoring, and helps you reflect on your understanding of the course content."},
    {advice: "It's not the end of the world if you fail your midterms"},
    {advice: "Always make a detailed plan for your course selection!! I regret not doing this when I was in my first year."},
    {advice: "Not sure if this is for everyone but don't be intimidated by the advanced courses. It may be hard, but truth is every course is kind of hard no matter what you take (at least for me). If you have an inkling to try them, I heard they were incredibly rewarding and to some, their favourite courses in first year."},
    {advice: "For MATH135, understanding theorems will get you much farther than memorization. For any MATH course, practice is key. Especially if you aren\'t naturally gifted."},
