   Academic integrity violations including but not limited to cheating is a very serious offense. You may want to be 
   familiar with what constitutes an academic offense and the potential consequences. A complete list of the University 
   Policies, Guidelines, and Academic Regulations can be found in <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/group/uWaterloo-Policies-Guidelines-Academic-Regulations">this section</a> 
   of the Academic Calendar. If you ever find yourself needing support in navigating through these academic policies, <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/caps/">WUSA CAPS</a> is a student support service to assist 
   Waterloo students in filing petitions, grievances and appeals.
