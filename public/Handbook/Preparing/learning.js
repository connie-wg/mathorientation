        Now that we're ready and have begun our classes, it's useful to know about effective tips and habits to succeed in 
        University-level courses. Although slightly dated, Dan Wolczuk's series on 
        <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/CTE/learning2learn2018.html">Learning how to Learn</a> 
        is still incredibly relevant.

    <p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/tutoring-centre">The Math Tutoring Centre</a> 
    is available to all students for help in First & Second Year core math courses. Tutors 
    are available in-person and virtually. Similarly, the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-undergraduate-students/computer-science-consulting-center">
