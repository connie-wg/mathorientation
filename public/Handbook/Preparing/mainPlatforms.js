   These are the main platforms you will be using for your courses, though others may exist in rare cases. 
   </p>
   <p>
   <strong>LEARN</strong>: The go-to platform for the content for all your courses. See 
   <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help/">here</a> for LEARN help.
   </p>
   <p>
   Piazza: Forum-like website where you can post individual questions in public or private for an instructor to answer. 
   </p>
   <p>
   Crowdmark: Assignments, especially written ones, are usually submitted and graded on 
   <a href="https://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a> if not to LEARN directly.
   </p>
   <p>
   Microsoft Teams: Default platform for instant messaging and video conferencing at UWaterloo. 
   Instructors may choose to use channels on MS Teams to facilitate discussion, hold office hours, or streamed lectures.  
   </p>
   <p>
   Odyssey: The main thing <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/">Odyssey</a> is used for is exam scheduling. 
   For midterms and finals, the time, locations, and your specific seating for your exams can be found here.
