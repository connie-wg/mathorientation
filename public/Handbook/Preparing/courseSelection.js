            Selecting, adding, and dropping courses is done on Quest, but the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/registering-courses/course-selection-period">Registrarâ€™s Office</a> is the place to go for any questions about waitlists, capacities, or enrollment. Be mindful of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/list">important dates</a> for deadlines for each term on when a course must be added/dropped as well as what penalties will be incurred if these deadlines are missed. <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/teaching/schedule/expert">This</a> is also a great site to get the most up-to-date information on which courses are being offered and (almost) live data on the capacities for each class.
