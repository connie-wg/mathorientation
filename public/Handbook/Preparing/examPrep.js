    One memorable experience to finish off the end of your first term will be your first final exams. 
    The exam schedule is released around 7 to 8 weeks after the start of the term and can be found through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">Registrar's Office</a>. Alternatively, 
    you can access your exam schedule online via Portal.

    Exam dates are strictly enforced and exceptions due to travel plans are rarely granted. You must schedule your travel 
    plans around your exams and not the other way around. A return flight home is not a valid excuse for missing an exam.

    If you are sick on the day of an exam, you may be able to defer your exam to the next term the course is offered. 
    The Math Undergrad Office (explained in the next section) can help you out, but you still need to obtain a medical 
    certificate or doctor's note. In the case of COVID-19, there is a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness-isolation.">self-declaration form</a> 
    which is accessible via Quest.
