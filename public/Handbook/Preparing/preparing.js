            <p>
            These are the main platforms you will be using for your courses, though others may exist in rare cases. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>LEARN</strong>: The go-to platform for the content for all your courses. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help/">here</a> for LEARN help.
            </p>
            <p>
            Piazza: Forum-like website where you can post individual questions in public or private for an instructor to answer. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Crowdmark: Assignments, especially written ones, are usually submitted and graded on <a href="https://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a> if not to LEARN directly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Microsoft Teams: Default platform for instant messaging and video conferencing at UWaterloo. Instructors may choose to use channels on MS Teams to facilitate discussion, hold office hours, or streamed lectures.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Odyssey: The main thing <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/">Odyssey</a> is used for is exam scheduling. For midterms and finals, the time, locations, and your specific seating for your exams can be found here.

         {title: 'Textbooks',
          text: <div>
            <p>Textbooks can be expensive. But from experience, it is very rare that a student must purchase a physical textbook for a course where an online textbook or the course notes will not suffice. The general recommendation is to read the course syllabus very carefully and double-check with the professors if there are alternative ways to access the course content before you are certain that a physical textbook purchase is actually necessary. If going down this route, also double check the edition, as some courses tend to switch textbook editions every few years, and the material may not be the same. The UWaterloo Library has many online resources for textbooks available as well as access to a large number of academic databases which are free to access as a UWaterloo student. Check out the links for the <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/">UWaterloo Library</a>. 
                The <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca">WStore</a>, <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/course-materials/my-booklook.html">BookLook</a>, and the <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/food-retail/used-bookstore/">WUSA Used Book Store</a> are also good places to look for textbooks. </p>

            <p>
            Selecting, adding, and dropping courses is done on Quest, but the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/registering-courses/course-selection-period">Registrar’s Office</a> is the place to go for any questions about waitlists, capacities, or enrollment. Be mindful of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/list">important dates</a> for deadlines for each term on when a course must be added/dropped as well as what penalties will be incurred if these deadlines are missed. <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/teaching/schedule/expert">This</a> is also a great site to get the most up-to-date information on which courses are being offered and (almost) live data on the capacities for each class.

        {title: 'The Academic Calendar',

            <p> 
            The undergraduate calendar is the most comprehensive and accurate collection of information about academic programs that you can find. Ever wonder exactly what you will learn in Actuarial Science, Applied Math, or any other major at UWaterloo? A comprehensive list of all the majors offered by the Math Faculty? Degree requirements, course descriptions, scholarship and bursary information, academic policies and more are all contained in this <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca">website</a>.

            Any more unanswered questions about degree requirements, academic policies, failing a course, and anything else relating to academics? Your academic advisors are here to help! See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-advising">here</a> for Math Academic Advising and also the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/office-hours">CS Advising Office</a>.

        {title: 'Learning How to Learn',
        text: <div>
            <p>Now that we’re ready and have begun our classes, it’s useful to know about effective tips and habits to succeed in University-level courses. Although slightly dated, Dan Wolczuk’s series on <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~pkates/CTE/learning2learn2018.html">Learning how to Learn</a> is still incredibly relevant. </p>
            <p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/tutoring-centre">The Math Tutoring Centre</a> is available to all students for help in First & Second Year core math courses. Tutors are available in-person and virtually. Similarly, the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-undergraduate-students/computer-science-consulting-center">Computer Science Consulting Center</a> offers help on First & Second Year core CS courses. </p>

        {title: 'Preparing for Exams',
        text: <div>
            <p> 
            One memorable experience with which to finish off the end of your first term would be your first final exams. The exam schedule becomes available around 7 to 8 weeks after the start of the term and can be found with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">Registrar’s Office</a>. Alternatively, you can access your exam schedule online via Portal. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Exam dates are strictly enforced and exceptions due to travel plans are rarely granted. You must schedule your travel plans around your exams and not the other way around. A return flight home is not a valid excuse for missing an exam.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you are sick on the day of an exam, you may be able to defer your exam to the next term the course is offered. The Math Undergrad Office (explained in the next section) can help you out, but you still need to obtain a medical certificate or doctor’s note. In the case of COVID-19, there is the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness-isolation.">self-declaration form</a> which is accessible via Quest.

        {title: 'Academic Policies',
         text: <div>
            <p>
            Academic integrity violations including but not limited to cheating is a very serious offense. You may want to be familiar with what constitutes an academic offense and the potential consequences. A complete list of the University Policies, Guidelines, and Academic Regulations can be found in <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/group/uWaterloo-Policies-Guidelines-Academic-Regulations">this section</a> of the Academic Calendar. If you ever find yourself needing support in navigating through these academic policies, <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/caps/">WUSA CAPS</a> is a student support service to assist Waterloo students in filing petitions, grievances and appeals.
