        <p>Textbooks can be expensive. But from experience, it is very rare that a student must purchase a physical textbook 
            for a course where an online textbook or the course notes will not suffice. The general recommendation is to read 
            the course syllabus very carefully and double-check with the professors if there are alternative ways to access 
            the course content before you are certain that a physical textbook purchase is actually necessary. If going down 
            this route, also double check the edition, as some courses tend to switch textbook editions every few years, and 
            the material may not be the same. The UWaterloo Library has many online resources for textbooks available as well 
            as access to a large number of academic databases which are free to access as a UWaterloo student. Check out the 
            links for the <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/">UWaterloo Library</a>. 
            The <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca">WStore</a>, <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/course-materials/my-booklook.html">BookLook</a>, 
            and the <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/food-retail/used-bookstore/">WUSA Used Book Store</a> are also good places to 
            look for textbooks.
