            Your Watcard will be the main piece of physical ID for University purposes that also functions as an access/payment card for much of the University's services, 
            such as accessing the gym or paying for food with your meal plan. Your Watcard also serves as a transit pass for Grand River Transit buses and ION light rail. 
            Make sure you have signed up for your Watcard in the first weeks - more details about its usage and how to get it are found
