                    The <a href="https://wusa.ca">Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association</a> (WUSA) is a corporation run 
                    by students for students, helping students. Think of it as MathSoc, but on a cross-campus scale across 
                    all faculties. And just like MathSoc, you\'re already a member! WUSA does quite a lot to make your campus 
                    a great place, check out all their services and initiatives on their website.

                    Getting involved with WUSA is easy. You can get involved as a director to represent your fellow students 
                    or attend general meetings and referendums to voice your opinion on student issues. 
                    You can also get involved by starting or joining a club, volunteering for a service, or becoming a part of 
                    WUSA. Check out the full list of current available <a href="https://wusa.ca/jobs-opportunities/">
                        opportunities</a>.

                Clubs at UWaterloo have been growing over the last few years and there are now about 250 clubs under WUSA alone.

                <p>
                There is likely something that will interest you, and if you cannot find a club that already satisfies your 
                interest, you can always start your own! A comprehensive directory of currently 
                <a href="https://wusa.ca/clubs/">active clubs</a> is provided by WUSA.   
                </p>
                <p>
                You can join a club by emailing them or signing up at the Clubs and Societies Days, which typically take place 
                at the beginning of each term.
