                In order to switch into Co-op, you apply in your 1B term. See the full list of rules <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/co-op">here</a>. Any additional questions regarding Co-op can be directed to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/contact-co-operative-education/your-co-op-advisors">Co-op Advisors</a>. 
                Note that switching into Co-op is extremely competitive.

                    The tool that UWaterloo students use to find both Co-op and regular jobs is called <a href="http://waterlooworks.uwaterloo.ca">WaterlooWorks</a>. It is the online system that allows students to search and apply for jobs. Accounts are automatically set up for students, and students log in using their Quest information. 
                    Even if you are not in a Co-op program, you can apply for summer or part-time jobs through WaterlooWorks. The system is also used to post full-time post graduation positions.

                    <p>
                    If you are in a Co-op program, you will use WaterlooWorks the term before your Co-op term to look for and apply to jobs. 
                    Interviews are typically done on campus during the study term before your Co-op term and can span several weeks.
