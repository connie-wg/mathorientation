            The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/muo">Math Undergraduate Office</a> (MUO) is the place to go for general 
            questions about academics, courses, and careers. For these, the MUO will almost always know the answers; if they 
            don't, they'll direct you to the someone who does! They can be contacted at mathuo@uwaterloo.ca. Additionally, 
            the MUO is located in MC 4022, which is in the Mathematics and Computer (MC) building. The office hours and the 
            list of office staff can be found on their site.
