            This is the place to go if you need to drop off a form (CPP form, OSAP, course override, plan modification, etc), 
            get a transcript or a proof of enrolment letter, deal with financial aid (see the financial aid section for more 
            information), have exam schedule conflicts, or want to access the other academic-related services. 
            They also provide various forms for academic matters that you may need during your time at the university. 
            You can find a complete list of those forms <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/forms/undergraduate-studies/">online</a>.
