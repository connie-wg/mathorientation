            After First Year, you will likely be living off-campus. Thus, the great off-campus housing hunt begins. Before you start, make a list of what you want in your place of residence.

            This process is generally outside the scope of the University so many 
            platforms exist in the wild to find off-campus housing. Some good resources for finding housing include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/110354088989367">Facebook Sublet Pages: Student Housing in Waterloo</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WaterlooSublet/">Facebook Sublet Pages: UW/WLU Subletting</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.kijiji.ca/">Kijiji</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.places4students.com/Places/School?SchoolID=VBThwOQPAX4=">Off-campus listings on the UW Campus Housing page</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            There are many more such groups on Facebook, just search "Student Housing Waterloo". Make sure to always read over your lease completely before 
            signing a rental or sublet agreement. This is the best way to protect yourself from any issues. 
            Make sure to understand your rights and responsibilities as a tenant. <a href="http://www.sjto.gov.on.ca/ltb/">The Landlord and Tenant Board provides this information on their website</a>.

            And finally, beware of scammers! Always ask for a live video tour of the listing before signing anything or sending any money, 
            and never give out your SIN, bank account number, or debit/credit card information.
