            The Mathematics Society (MathSoc) is the student-run society for all Mathematics students at the University of Waterloo (including Computer Science and Software Engineering students). 
            The office is located on the 3rd floor of the Mathematics and Computing Building (MC) in room 3038. Student volunteers manage the office and all members of the society are students.

            MathSoc also advocates for Mathematics students and their interests, making sure they have a voice in student council and changes within the university.

            There are six executive positions, two of which are elected - the President and Vice President Academic. The other four Vice President positions (in charge of Internal, Operations, Communications and Finances) are appointed. 
            There are also various volunteer positions available, such as being an office volunteer, helping out with finances, and many more! You can also become a student representative and make decisions on behalf of your peers in your program.
