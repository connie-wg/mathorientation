    text: 'Textbooks can be expensive. But from experience, it is very rare that a student must purchase a physical textbook for a course where an online textbook or the course notes will not suffice. The general recommendation is to read the course syllabus very carefully and double-check with the professors if there are alternative ways to access the course content before you are certain that a physical textbook purchase is actually necessary. If going down this route, also double check the edition, as some courses tend to switch textbook editions every few years, and the material may not be the same. The UWaterloo Library has many online resources for textbooks available as well as access to a large number of academic databases which are free to access as a UWaterloo student. Check out the links for the UWaterloo Library. The WStore, BookLook, and the WUSA Used Book Store are also good places to look for textbooks.',
